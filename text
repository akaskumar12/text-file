The .TXT file format has a long history, intertwined with the early days of computing. Most likely developed between the 1960s and the 70s, the format was used for storage due to simplicity and compatibility, as well as a low byte count, which was a vital factor due to limited storage when using old computing hardware. 

 

The text file format was most likely developed by early computing companies and used by engineers for basic information storage. As it evolved, it became popular with the public, before it was eventually pushed aside in favour of more complex document formats.

 

 

What are .TXT files used for?
 

Although quite basic and lacking in formatting features, the .TXT/TEXT format still has a variety of practical uses: 

 

Writing text. 
 

While formats such as .DOC and PDF do a much better job of displaying the written word in visually appealing ways, text file documents can be useful when you need a simple file format or if you don’t have the appropriate software to write in more complex formats.

 

Raw data management and storage.
 

.TXT documents are often used to store data in an easily readable format that won’t suffer from computability issues. The raw data for projects such as financial reports, code etc. can be stored and then moved to more complex software for final processing and presentation.

 

Software code and system logs.
 

.TXT files are used in software applications, servers and other frameworks. Coders also use this format to store code for programming languages, because it is a basic readable format that developers and other computer users can utilise.
